# Tic tac toe
Simple version of Tic tac toe made from zero using Python.

It uses the standard input/output as the interface for the game, at least for now.

[WORK IN PROGRESS] : Currently, I'm making the interface with Tkinter and migrating the game logic.
                      Because of that, the game is not working right now.


**Features**
- Functional grid, gameplay and CPU.
- Simple instructions.
- Choice to play multiple times.
  

**Ideas**
- Upgrade the CPU's chances of winning (still very dumb).
- Allow the player to choose their and the CPU's symbol in the grid.
- Make a more instructive tutorial, specially on how to use the input with text.
- Implement a local multiplayer option.
- Create an interface for the game.
