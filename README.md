# Tic_tac_toe
Simple version of Tic-tac-toe made from zero in Python 3.

It uses the standard input/output as the interface for the game, at least for now.


**Features**
- Functional grid, gameplay and CPU.
- Simple instructions.
- Choice to play multiple times.
  

**Ideas**
- Upgrade the CPU's chances of winning (still very dumb).
- Allow the player to choose their and the CPU's symbol in the grid.
- Make a more instructive tutorial, specially on how to use the input with text.
- Implement a local multiplayer option.
- Create an interface for the game.
